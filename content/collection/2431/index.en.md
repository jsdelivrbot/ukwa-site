# E-publishing Trends/Emerging Formats

Electronic publishing refers to the digital publication of e-books and electronic articles and to the development of digital libraries and catalogues. E-publishing is a growing phenomenon which uses innovative technologies to enable individuals, scholars and communities to establish contacts, exchange data, and share knowledge. Many works, especially scientific journals and popular works of fiction are increasingly only published online. This collection of websites, curated by staff at the British Library, is intended to reflect this growing trend and includes e-books, a publisher's online addenda to a printed book, an experiment in the novel as a blog and sites about the impact of digital technologies upon writing.
