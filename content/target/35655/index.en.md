# Independent Academies Association (IAA)

The IAA was established in 2002 as a membership organisation to offer guidance on best practice. Since 2010, the number of academies has grown from 203 to more than 4,000. But, at the same time, the need for a single membership body has started to decline due to the growth in multi-academy trusts (MATs), which provide services for their member schools.  

Therefore less academies were availing of the IAA services due to the emergence of MATs. On the 11th of June 2015 the IAA announced that the organisation was to be liquidated.
