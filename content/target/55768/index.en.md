# Royal College of Radiologists: Further clarity and assurance needed for patients who require diagnosis and treatment using radioisotopes

The Royal College of Radiologists is seeking further reassurance from the Government that leaving Euratom will not affect the UK supply of vital diagnostic and cancer-treating materials â€“ radioisotopes. Many of these materials reach us via EU-based nuclear reactors. Anything impacting the supply and transport of radioisotopes has the potential to delay imaging scans and radiotherapy treatment.
