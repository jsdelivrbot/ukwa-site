# Deaf Sector Partnership

The Deaf Sector Partnership is made up of five delivery partners and two support partners.

The delivery partners are:
•British Deaf Association Scotland (BDA Scotland)
•Deaf Action
•Deafblind Scotland (DbS)
•National Deaf Children’s Society Scotland (NDCS Scotland)
•Scottish Council on Deafness (SCoD)

The support partners are:

The Scottish Government which directs the Deaf Sector Partnership and the Voluntary Action Fund (VAF) which provides support and monitoring.

April 2016 – Deaf Connections took the decision not to apply for further funding for the work that they were doing with the Deaf Sector Partnership. We would like to take this opportunity to thank them for the work they did with us and wish them all the best for the future.

In 2016/2017, the DSP work will focus on these primary outcomes:
1.To support the development of the BSL National Advisory Group (the NAG);
2.To support people whose first or preferred language is BSL (including Deaf BSL users, Deafblind BSL users, Deaf/Deafblind people from equality and diversity groups whose first or preferred language is BSL, and people with additional language/support needs whose first or preferred language is BSL)  to be as involved as they want to be in the development of the first BSL National Plan; and
3.To support public bodies to be more inclusive of people whose first or preferred language is BSL and to support them to meet their duties under the BSL (Scotland) Act.

Each organisation, while being funded separately, will collaborate and work in partnership with the other four organisations as well as the Scottish Government and the Voluntary Action Fund.

The partnership will work to the following principles:
•Openness and transparency
•Fairness and collaboration
•Quality and scrutiny.

We will take an asset-based approach that is person-centred and rights-based. We will have a training / learning programme that will ensure everyone involved in the partnership understands the messages and ideas that we are working with and towards. We will also work using a whole team approach as the Deaf / Deafblind people who use BSL as their first or preferred language have needs that may need to be addressed through contact with other organisations and agencies.

We will all be open to comment from others in the partnership, including but not limited to the Scottish Government and the Voluntary Action Fund.

Each organisation will act as a critical friend to the others in the partnership. Each organisation will bring knowledge and expertise to the table in order to move the work forward.

As our work will impact on Deaf/Deafblind BSL users and others whose first or preferred language is BSL and public bodies across Scotland, we will all be open to collaborative working with other deaf sector organisations and mainstream organisations in the Third Sector as well as with the Public and Private Sectors. Organisations will report on individual project work as required by the funding body.
