The fishing industry represents a very small part of the UKâ€™s GDP. Yet it is
of great importance to many coastal communities across the UK. Successful
fisheries management is also vital to the health of the wider marine environment. Withdrawing from the Common Fisheries Policy gives the UK the opportunity to develop a fisheries management regime that is tailored to the conditions of UK waters and its fleet.
