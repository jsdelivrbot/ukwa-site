# St. Luke's & Christ Church, Chelsea

St Luke's and Christ Church - One parish, two churches, giving heart and soul to the Chelsea community.

This church was consecrated by the Bishop of London on St Luke’s Day, 18th October 1824 and was built because the original parish church (now known as Chelsea Old Church) was regarded as too small for the increasing population.

The decision to build it was made at a public meeting in 1818 and the foundation stone was laid on October 12th 1820. The Rector at the time was the brother of the Duke of Wellington, the Hon. & Revd Gerald Valerian Wellesley DD. St Luke’s is regarded as being one of the first Neo-Gothic churches to be built in London: the nave, 60ft in height, is the tallest of any parish church in London and the tower reaches a height of 142 feet.
