Games Monitor is a network of people raising awareness about issues within the London Olympic development processes.

We want to highlight the local, London and international implications of the Olympic industry. We seek to deconstruct the 'fantastic' hype of Olympic boosterism and the eager complicity of the 'urban elites' in politics, business, the media, sport, academia and local institutional 'community stakeholders'.

Our network operates with an open, dynamic principle, and functions as a discussion forum, research body, press and political lobby. Our website and online group provide hubs for publication, information exchange and solidarity networking. We are also a contact point for local, minority, and specialist interviewees for press and broadcast media.
