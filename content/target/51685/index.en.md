# Civitas: The UK’s trillion euro counter-claim against the EU

Suggests that the UK should respond to the European Union's demand for a £50bn contribution to its budget when we leave by claiming a Euro 1 trillion refund of money from the EU's coffers. This would compensate Britain for contributions misused by the EU, and for the impact of some misconceived EU policies.
