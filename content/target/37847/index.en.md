# Tamworth Families at War: Unlocking their Great War Stories

Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, our project enabled people who now live in and around the town to delve into the past in search of their ancestor and given the ten-fold growth of Tamworth since the Great War, the majority of the present population inevitably have family origins outside the area. This is reflected in the results of their research which reveal stories from every corner of the UK , and also around the world.
