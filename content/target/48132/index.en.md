# Quaker Concern for the Abolition of Torture 

The aim of the site is to help you get more informed on the subject of torture and its use in the world today. We believe that once people, such as you, understand the terrible harm done by torture, and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment, you may wish to get involved in finding ways to eradicate its use.
