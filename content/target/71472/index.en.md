# Independent: Rejection of Theresa May's Brexit plan could trigger second referendum, admits Treasury minister

A Treasury minister admitted that Theresa May could be forced to bow to mounting pressure for a fresh Brexit referendum if the Chequers  plan was rejected – with the option to halt EU withdrawal “altogether”. Mel Stride delivered a huge boost to the campaign for a “People’s Vote” when he acknowledged: “There is a danger of that happening if Chequers doesn’t prevail”.
