<p>This project will tell the unknown stories of Bedford Physical Training College students during WW1 and WW2. Trained in teaching and massage the ‘Bedford Girls’ tended war wounded during the First War and washed socks of soldiers returning from Dunkirk, 1940. Working alongside the local community, they selflessly supported war efforts. Utilising the College Archive, collaborating with Bedford Highland Regiment Association, local historians and volunteers, a DVD for schools, universities and communities will be produced. Photographs, film, documents, written and recorded memories will be used to learn and research the social history of Bedford Physical Training during the World Wars.</p>
