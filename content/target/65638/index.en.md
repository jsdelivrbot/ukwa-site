# Wildlife Trusts: Brexit and Wildlife

The Wildlife Trusts care for 2,300 diverse and beautiful nature reserves, from remote woods and rivers to inner city nature parks, and most people live within a few miles of one of these special places. We run marine conservation projects around the coast and campaign for protection of our seas.
 

Our roots are local. Each of the 47 Wildlife Trusts has been formed by groups of active and motivated people getting together to make a difference where they live.
