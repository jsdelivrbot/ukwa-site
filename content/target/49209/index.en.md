# Whole Food Action

Whole Food Action host a map of independent wholefood shops. They see these shops as part of a movement towards a food system that is fair, healthy, and ecologically sustainable. We also think they have a big role to play in campaigning for such a system. 

Their site is intended to:

locate indie wholefood shops around the UK
get informed and campaign for food sovereignty
be inspired to set up a new shop or co-op!
