The English Democrats is an English nationalist political party in England.
The party proposes a devolved English Parliament, and has suggested that England should become an independent country. It presents itself as an English equivalent to the Scottish National Party, though the Scottish National Party is generally considered to be a centre-left party, whereas the English Democrats are on the right of the political spectrum. The English Democrats have welcomed defectors from the far-right British National Party into leadership roles and former members of the party have criticised informal links with other far-right organisations, though party leader Robin Tilbrook has stated that party members are expected to pledge their opposition to racism.[
