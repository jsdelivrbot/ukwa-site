# Free Tibet 


Supporters for Tibet in London in 2014 

Our vision is a free Tibet in which Tibetans are able to determine their own future and the human rights of all are respected.

We campaign for an end to China's occupation of Tibet and for international recognition of Tibetans' right to freedom.
