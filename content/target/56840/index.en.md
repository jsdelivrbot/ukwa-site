# Department for Exiting the European Union: Confidentiality and Access to Documents

This paper states that the UK recognises the importance of continuing to respect obligations of confidentiality and to protect information exchanged while it was a Member State, and that arrangements agreed with respect to confidentiality and the handling of information produced while it was a Member State should be reciprocal, affording an equivalent level of protection to the UK and the EU after the UKâ€™s withdrawal.
