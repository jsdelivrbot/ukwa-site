Michael Cusacks has been up and running in West London since 2009.

We pride ourselves in being an open and friendly club; we support all our players and committee wherever we can; we are attracting large amounts of children to our club through our youth development, and we hope to grow continuously to eventually become a large GAA club, nurturing players from a young age, right up to adult level.
