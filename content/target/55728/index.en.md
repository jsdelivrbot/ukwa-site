On 29 March Theresa May sent a six-page letter notifying the EU of the UK's intention to leave.

But this previously obscure section was later put under the political spotlight, with some MPs, including a number of Conservatives, gearing up for a fight on the subject. One prominent Leave campaigner even said the UK should stay in Euratom after Brexit.
