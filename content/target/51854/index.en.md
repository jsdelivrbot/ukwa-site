# House of Commons Exiting the European Union Committee: The Governmentâ€™s negotiating objectives: the White Paper

The Exiting the European Union Committee concludes in its report that the Government's assertion that "no deal is better than a bad deal" is unsubstantiated without an economic assessment of "no deal" having been done and without evidence that steps are being taken to mitigate what would be the damaging effect of such an outcome.
