The Administration is the civil government of the Sovereign Base Areas. The Headquarters of the SBAA is at Episkopi. Its range of interest is that of any civil government but, many of its functions, particularly in respect of the Cypriot inhabitants of the SBAs, are carried out by Republican officials on behalf of the Administration under delegated powers. The SBAA itself carries out those functions directly related to the exercise of sovereignty and the fulfillment of the UK’s commitments under the 1960 Declaration on the Administration of the Areas including – the enactment of legislation, maintenance of law and order and the control of immigration and development.
