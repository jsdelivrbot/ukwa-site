# UK Transplant

 UK Transplant helps save thousands of lives every year. As part of NHS Blood and Transplant, our key role is to ensure that organs donated for transplant are matched and allocated to patients in a fair and unbiased way. Matching, particularly in the case of kidneys, is so important that donation and allocation needs to be organised nationally. The larger the pool, the better the likelihood of a good match.
