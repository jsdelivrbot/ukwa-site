This Commons Library briefing analyses the Trade Bill, which was published on 7 November 2017. The Trade Bill is one of a series of “Brexit Bills” intended to adjust UK legislation for Brexit, in addition to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. Together with the Customs Bill (the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill), the Bill is intended to allow the UK to continue its existing trade policy as far as possible immediately after Brexit. The Bill is not intended to deal with future trade agreements with the EU or other countries.
