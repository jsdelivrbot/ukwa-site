# British Homeopathic Association

The British Homeopathic Association exists to promote homeopathy practised by doctors and other healthcare professionals. 

We strongly believe that homeopathy should be fully integrated into the healthcare system and available as a treatment choice for everyone. 

As a charity founded in 1902, we have a long-established reputation for providing authoritative information and supporting research and training in homeopathy.

We work closely with the Faculty of Homeopathy, the professional body for doctors and other healthcare professionals who have qualified in homeopathy and incorporate it into their everyday practice.
