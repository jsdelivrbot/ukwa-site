# Rainbow Dragon: LGBT and Welsh History

This is a blog by Norena Shopland and provides articles on LGBT history across Wales. She is the author of 'Forbidden Lives: LGBT Stories from Wales' – the first book on Welsh LGBT history. As she researched the book, she came across a lot of material which has never been published and which didn’t fit into the  book. The best way to share this would be to establish a 'Rainbow Dragon: LGBT and Welsh History' blog and and bring the information into the public domain.
