# House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee:  Ensuring strong equalities legislation after the  UK exit

The Committee concludes that  ensuring that equality protections are maintained is not simply a matter of transposing existing EU law. In order to protect rights, the Government needs to take active steps to embed equality into domestic law and policy. The steps the committee recommends would entrench equality into the UK legal and policy framework and would ensure that the UK retains a strong, undiminished record of equality after it leaves the EU.
