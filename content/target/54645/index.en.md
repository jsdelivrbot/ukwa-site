# Healthcare Management Trust

The Healthcare Management Trust was founded in 1985 because healthcare providers founded by religious groups increasingly needed support and consultancy services in order to operate effectively.  Our aim is to develop and promote the clinical and care services offered by our associated charitable hospitals and care homes. Through our support and consultancy we can continue to support viable alternatives to commercial providers, today and in the future. HMT is a registered charity.
