The message that Theresa May wanted, and arguably needed to get across in her Mansion House speech on the Uk's future economic relationship with the EU, was way beyond any of the detailed arguments that lead the Tory party, the EU, or both, down a cul-de-sac.

It won't be easy, I'm confessing to my party and the public that I won't get everything they want, but I get it, and now, after everything that's happened, let's talk.
