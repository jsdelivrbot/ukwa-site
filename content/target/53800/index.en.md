# Education Policy Institute (EPI): General Election 2017: An Analysis of Manifesto Plans for Education

Ahead of the 2017 General Election, this analysis considers the extent to which each of the parties address some of the key challenges facing education today, as well as whether their policies appear to be based on credible evidence of likely impact. Where possible, EPI compared each partyâ€™s spending commitments with their own estimates of likely costs. They have not attempted to analyse in any detail the credibility of the revenue assumptions which underlie the education spending commitments, unless these involve a transfer from within the education budget.
