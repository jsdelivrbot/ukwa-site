# Ayya 2 Cochabamba

We (ayya) are two people travelling from the UK to Bolivia with various roles, as part of the Climate Justice Action, (CJA) working group, as members of Rising Tide, No Borders and Trapese Popular Education Collective. We will be collecting video, audio and interviews, to build our understandings. When we return we will co-produce a booklet about social movements and climate justice as well as organising talks and workshops.
